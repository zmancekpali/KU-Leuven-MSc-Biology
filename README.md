# KU-Leuven-MSc-Biology

My Ku Leuven MSc repo - includes all the code to my master courses and additional files which contain past coding files from my undergraduate studies.

## Coding etiquette for this repository:

The following rules should be upheld at all times when coding or working in this repo:

Informative comments are included throughout the code, using the hashtag (#) symbol. There are no spaces before the hashtags.
The code is spaced out to make it easier to read.
The work is broken down into sections (by adding ---- at the end of each section title if necessary).
All objects are given informative names (object names do not include capital letters and are separated by _ if necessary).
Keep your code to under 100 characters in length per line (comments can extend past that if necessary).
